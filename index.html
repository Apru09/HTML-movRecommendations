            <li>
                    <h3>Demon Slayer <em>aka <a href="https://demonslayer-anime.com/">Kimetsu no yaiba</em></a></h3>
                    <p>This is the best anime I've known ever. You get every emotion out of it and also
                        the storyline of the anime is extremely exciting.
                    </p>

            <li>
                    <h3><a href="https://naruto-official.com/en?nolangsuggestion=1">Naruto OG</a></h3>
                    <p>I can't compare this to my first recommendation however, I can say that
                        even this anime covers all the emotions, has amazing fights, and it gives
                        you a ninja like feel.
                    </p>
                    <img src="./Naruto.jpeg" alt = "Naruto" height = "300" width = "300"/>
            </li>
            <li>
                    <h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13417558/">Cute Programmer</a></h3>
                    <p>This is my all time favourite and my first ever dramas. This is the 
                        story of a young girl who falls in love with a gaming company's owner.
                        Things get interesting when both of them start liking each other and don't 
                        let their feelings out.
                    </p>
